The traffic light controller designed in Verilog utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to manage the sequencing of traffic lights at an intersection. 
It employs clock signals for timing and state transitions, ensuring accurate control of North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) traffic flows.
Outputs are synchronized to simulate realistic traffic scenarios, enhancing safety and efficiency in urban traffic management systems.
Designing a traffic light controller using Verilog involves creating a digital circuit that manages the sequencing and timing of traffic lights at an intersection. Hereâ€™s a structured description of how this is typically approached:

Traffic Light Controller Design in Verilog
Components and Logic:
Finite State Machine (FSM):

States: Define states such as NS_Green, NS_Yellow, EW_Green, EW_Yellow.
Transitions: Control state transitions based on timing and input conditions (e.g., pedestrian crossings, sensor inputs).
Input Handling:

Clock Signal: Synchronizes the timing of state transitions and light changes.
Reset Signal: Initializes the controller and sets it to a default state (e.g., NS_Green).
Output Generation:

Light Signals: Control signals for each traffic light (NS_Green, NS_Yellow, NS_Red, EW_Green, EW_Yellow, EW_Red).
Timing Logic: Implement timers to determine how long each light stays on before transitioning to the next state.
Synchronization and Control:

Intersection Management: Ensure mutual exclusivity (only one direction can have the green light at a time) and proper sequencing of light changes.
Pedestrian Signals: Integrate pedestrian crossing signals if applicable, synchronized with traffic light changes.

State Machine: Controls transitions between NS (North-South) and EW (East-West) states based on the clock signal and internal logic.
Timing Logic: Determines the duration of each state before transitioning to the next based on specific timing requirements.
Output Logic: Sets the appropriate signals (NS_Green, NS_Yellow, EW_Green, EW_Yellow) to control the actual traffic lights.

Conclusion:
Implementing a traffic light controller in Verilog involves defining states, managing transitions, and controlling outputs to simulate real-world traffic scenarios effectively. 
This digital design approach ensures efficient and safe traffic flow management at intersections.
